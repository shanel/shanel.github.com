  <div class="entry-content"><p>I returned from SF recently. I went to college in the Bay Area and my company&#8217;s headquarters is there as well. Most of my college friends still live there. I left the Bay Area six years ago for New York.</p>

<p>I assumed when I moved here that either I would get closer with friends from work or I would find new friends. Six years later, neither of these things have really occurred, or if they have they are now strained by changes in people&#8217;s lives. In the back of my mind though, I saw myself as still part of that community of friends. I&#8217;m not so sure anymore.</p>

<p>Over those six years those friends have visited NYC individually. As they have I have heard about their lives and through them the lives of other friends. I understood in a theoretically that they were a community and deeply involved in one another&#8217;s lives, but never saw it explicitly. This gave my mind the chance to continue its belief that I could still be part of that community.</p>

<p>Visiting these friends in SF though, I feel that possibility slipping away. I see now that they have moved on with their lives - as a group. They have moved on without my being a part of that group. A number of them will be getting married soon, I wonder if I will be invited. Where in the past dinners with them would go on for hours, full of conversation. Now conversation dries up quickly because I am not a part of their world and thus don&#8217;t know the people they know who they normally would talk about.</p>

<p>I have another friend who had moved to NYC from the Bay Area. She was here a year or two when she had a major health incident. She has since moved back to the Bay Area because that is where all her friends were, where her support network was. I saw her when I was out there and she said she might have been able to stay in NYC if she had found a partner out here, someone to ground her. I got lucky and found a partner out here, but if I had not I might have done the same as she did.</p>

<p>A partner though does not a community make. I have been able to somewhat become a part of my partner&#8217;s friend group, but that doesn&#8217;t fill the void of real friends. If anything it might have been a crutch I thought I could lean on. A crutch isn&#8217;t meant to be used indefinitely.</p>

<p>Maybe it comes down to shared experiences. In college you meet people and stay with them to develop a history of shared experiences together. It is from this foundation that your future community can be formed. When you are unmoored from that foundation you won&#8217;t be grounded in another community until you have had shared experiences with those other people.</p>

<p>I am going to have to find that group of people and put in the time and effort to have those shared experiences.</p>
